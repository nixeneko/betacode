# Greek Beta Code Converter

- Converts Beta Code to polytonic Greek, and also opposite direction.
- Supports only subset of Beta Code related to polytonic Greek alphabets and basic punctuation. The subset is case-insensitive.
- Highly relies on Unicode nomalization (composition and decomposition), so the output is normalized (in terms of Unicode).
